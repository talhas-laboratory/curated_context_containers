Title: Der Blaue Reiter — Color, Spirituality, and Abstraction

Der Blaue Reiter was an expressionist group active in Munich in the early 1910s. Key members included Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Gabriele Münter, and August Macke.

The group was less a formal school and more a loose circle of artists and thinkers interested in:
- Spirituality in art.
- The inner sound of color and form.
- Moving away from naturalistic representation toward abstraction.

Kandinsky believed that colors have inner “sounds” or vibrations that directly affect the human soul. For example:
- Blue tends toward calm, depth, and spirituality.
- Yellow appears more earthly, aggressive, and extroverted.
- Green is the balance between blue and yellow and can feel static or complacent.

Franz Marc associated colors with emotional and symbolic roles:
- Blue: spirituality, masculinity, and the spiritual male principle.
- Yellow: joy, femininity, sometimes cruelty in excess.
- Red: matter, violence, and conflict.

Der Blaue Reiter Almanac presented essays, musical scores, and reproductions of folk art, children’s drawings, and non-Western art. The goal was to show that pure form and color could carry meaning independently of academic realism.

Compared to Die Brücke in Dresden:
- Der Blaue Reiter was more interested in spiritual abstraction and theoretical writing.
- Die Brücke focused more on raw, urban experience and sharply angular forms.

Der Blaue Reiter painters frequently:
- Used intense, non-naturalistic color to embody spiritual content.
- Reduced or distorted forms to emphasize inner necessity instead of visual correctness.
- Explored analogies between painting and music, treating colors as tones in a visual composition.
