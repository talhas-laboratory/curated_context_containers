Title: Expressionist Brushwork and Surface

This document describes how expressionist painters use brushwork, paint handling, and surface to intensify emotion.

In many expressionist paintings, brushwork is visible and deliberately rough. The goal is not to hide the artist’s hand but to make the act of painting itself part of the message.

Key techniques:
- Impasto: applying paint thickly so that it stands out from the canvas. Thick strokes catch light and create a physical rhythm.
- Broken color: laying distinct strokes of different colors side by side instead of blending them smoothly. From a distance, the colors mix optically; up close, the vibration remains visible.
- Gestural marks: fast, energetic brushstrokes that track the movement of the arm. The direction and speed of the stroke can imply agitation, calm, or violence.
- Scraping and scumbling: dragging a relatively dry brush or tool over an existing layer so that the underlying color shows through. This can create a worn, unstable surface.

Surface and drawing:
- Expressionist artists sometimes outline forms with dark, calligraphic lines and then fill them with agitated color.
- In other cases, the brushwork dissolves clear outlines and turns figures into swirls of paint.

Examples:
- A stormy sky might be composed of sweeping, diagonal strokes of blue, gray, and violet to suggest wind and turbulence.
- A figure could be built with thick, vertical strokes that seem to weigh down the body, conveying heaviness and fatigue.
- A city street can be rendered with short, flickering marks to evoke noise and crowd movement.

The important idea: brushwork is not neutral. Line direction, stroke length, thickness, and paint density all contribute to the emotional impact of the image. In expressionist painting, brushwork acts like handwriting that reveals the artist’s state of mind.
