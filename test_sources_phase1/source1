Title: Color, Emotion, and Harmony in Expressionist Painting

This document describes how color theory is used in expressionist art to convey emotion rather than realism.

Expressionist painters often break with naturalistic color. Instead of painting a sky blue and a face beige, they choose colors that express inner feeling: a green face for sickness or envy, a red sky for anxiety, a violet street for melancholy.

Key concepts in color theory:
- Hue: the basic family of a color (red, blue, yellow).
- Saturation: how intense or gray a color appears.
- Value (lightness): how light or dark a color is.

Johannes Itten’s teaching influenced many expressionist and modern painters. He emphasized:
- Complementary contrast: colors opposite on the color wheel (blue–orange, red–green, yellow–violet).
- Warm–cool contrast: warm colors like red and orange appear to advance, cool colors like blue and green appear to recede.
- Simultaneous contrast: a color can appear different depending on its surrounding color.

Expressionist works often use:
- High saturation and strong complementary pairs to create visual tension.
- Limited, “themed” palettes to create a specific mood (for example, mostly blue and green for calm sadness).
- Deliberate value contrast: very dark outlines against very bright inner areas.

Example scenarios:
- An expressionist portrait might use a blue–green face with orange shadows to express alienation.
- A cityscape might use clashing red and green building fronts to communicate chaos and noise.
- A landscape might avoid natural greens entirely, using violet and yellow to evoke spiritual intensity.

In expressionism, color is an independent actor: it does not just describe objects, it expresses the artist’s inner state.
