- Investigated sandbox upload queueing; found ingestion jobs stuck because workers service was not running. Started workers via compose and verified queued jobs for `graphic_design` container transitioned to `done` with MinIO presigned URIs intact.
- Confirmed Claude MCP config does not need changes; `LLC_BASE_URL` and token remain valid. Noted merged Claude config includes the additional `codebase-explorer` MCP server alongside `local-latent-containers`.
- Documented current MCP token (`docker/mcp_token.txt`) and ready/merged Claude config files for reference; advised keeping workers + mcp services running for sandbox uploads.
