- Added modular graph UI components (GraphModeToggle, GraphQueryPanel, GraphDiagnosticsBar, GraphResultsTable) and wired ContainerSearchPage to use them with raw Cypher path, provenance tables, and reduced-motion handling.
- Added RTL tests for graph components and graph-mode flow; MSW handlers now mock graph_search.
- Updated BUILDPLAN_GRAPH_RAG checkboxes to reflect completed frontend components and a11y work; Step 8 frontend RTL marked done.
- Added Playwright graph E2E spec (`frontend/tests/e2e/graph.spec.ts`) and marked plan accordingly.
- Added backend graph service unit tests (`mcp-server/tests/test_graph_service.py`) covering graph search happy path (mocked Neo4j) and graph-enabled guard; acceptance/testing tasks still pending for integration/SDK.
- Added SDK graph unit tests (`agents-sdk/tests/test_client_graph.py`) using httpx MockTransport; plan SDK/gateway test item marked done.
- Added graph contract validation tests (`mcp-server/tests/test_api_contracts.py`) for request bounds/shape; integration Neo4j test still open.
- Added backend graph integration test skeleton (`mcp-server/tests/test_graph_integration.py`) that exercises upsert + search against Neo4j, skipping if services are unavailable.
