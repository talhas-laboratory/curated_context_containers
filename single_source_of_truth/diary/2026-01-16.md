- Mapped home server deployment requirements (always-on services, browser UI, MCP access, security, persistence).
- Evaluated repo readiness: backend/worker Dockerfiles and local compose exist; frontend container + production compose/proxy/secrets are missing.
- Created build plan `single_source_of_truth/work/BUILDPLAN_HOME_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT.md` detailing gap-bridging tasks and acceptance checks.
- Locked deployment decisions: Tailscale VPN-only access, buildx + GHCR images, agent-local MCP gateway.
- Confirmed reverse proxy via tailnet (`http://llc.<tailnet>`) and server data path `/srv/llc`.
- Added `frontend/Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and GHCR buildx workflow; updated frontend README and marked Phase 1 deployment tasks complete.
- Added `docker/compose.home.yaml` with GHCR image references, reverse proxy, and `/srv/llc` volumes; added `docker/Caddyfile` for `http://llc.<tailnet>` routing; marked Phase 2 compose tasks complete.
- Added GHCR buildx workflows for `mcp` and `workers` images; added `.dockerignore` files to slim build contexts; updated deployment plan checklist.
- Added `docker/.env.home.example` for server secrets and aligned compose CORS default; marked Phase 2 secrets task complete.
- Added `docs/DEPLOY_HOME_SERVER.md` with Tailscale, ufw, GHCR login, and deployment steps; documented Phase 3 runbook tasks.
