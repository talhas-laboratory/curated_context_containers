- Investigated chat-sandbox upload failures: `/api/sandbox/upload` 404s from proxy routing and client crashes from missing `crypto.randomUUID` on non-HTTPS.
- Routed `/api/sandbox/*` to the frontend in the home server Caddy proxy to avoid MCP path conflicts.
- Added a UUID fallback for chat-sandbox message IDs in non-secure contexts.
- Added drag-and-drop PDF upload handling in the chat sandbox with container gating and overlay feedback.
