# Progress Tracker — Milestone Status Board

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27T22:45:00Z  
**Current Phase:** 2 — Multimodal + Rerank (Planning)  
**Overall Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Phase 2 kickoff + frontend polish)  
**Recent Update (2025-11-27):** Phase 2 kickoff logged; ADR-003 (image ingest/crossmodal) and ADR-004 (rerank provider/cache) drafted; build plan updated; hashes refreshed. Session 3: "Ethereal Glass" frontend redesign completed; upload status bar with job polling implemented; troubleshooting patterns documented in LESSONS.md. **Session 4:** File management slice delivered — backend `/v1/documents/list|delete` endpoints with Qdrant/MinIO cleanup + API docs/tests, and frontend document panel with delete controls + MSW/Vitest coverage.

## Phase 1: MCP v1 Local Implementation

**Goal:** Functional single-container prototype with text/PDF ingestion and hybrid search  
**Target Date:** TBD  
**Status:** 🟢 Complete (100%)

### 1.1 Foundation & Documentation
- [🟢] Agent personas, SSoT structure, VISION, INDEX, diary discipline established.
- [🟢] Golden query set defined; runbooks published (setup/install, backup/restore, incident response).

### 1.2 Architecture & Decisions (Silent Architect)
- [🟢] SYSTEM, DATA_MODEL, API_CONTRACTS documented.
- [🟢] ADR-001 Postgres-native queue accepted; rerank ADR-002 drafted (adapter pending).
- [🟢] Hybrid retrieval flow (vector + BM25 + RRF + freshness + dedup) documented and implemented.

### 1.3 Backend Implementation (Silent Architect)
- [🟢] MCP endpoints live with auth/policy enforcement; manifest-driven latency budgets; diagnostics/issue codes.
- [🟢] Postgres/Qdrant/MinIO adapters hardened; ingestion pipelines (text/PDF) with dedup + embedding cache.
- [🟢] Integration test (ingest→search) and golden runner with latency budgets; structured metrics/logs shipped.
- [🟢] Rerank adapter implemented (opt-in, budget-guarded); performance/quality validation completed with golden (nDCG/recall=1.0, p95≈379 ms).

### 1.4 Frontend Implementation (IKB Designer)
- [🟢] Next.js App Router, MCP HTTP client + React Query hooks, gallery/search workspace, document modal, diagnostics rail.
- [🟢] Keyboard navigation, reduced-motion variant, Storybook stories for key components.
- [🟢] Frontend unit/RTL coverage with MSW + Vitest added; Playwright E2E search flow hardened and gated in CI; loading/empty/error/a11y states improved across home + container search.

### 1.5 Integration, Testing, and Automation
- [🟢] Makefile/compose targets (`migrate`, `smoke`, `golden`) green; CI workflow runs migrate → pytest+cov → smoke → golden (E2E optional).
- [🟢] Golden queries enforce latency budgets; artifacts produced (baseline + rerank, p95≈428 ms baseline / 448 ms rerank, ndcg_avg≈0.823, recall_avg≈0.8).
- [🟢] Latency/error-path tests and PDF E2E added; golden expanded with PDF and no-hit/latency cases; rerank budget guard covered.

### 1.6 Documentation & Close-Out
- [🟢] CONTEXT/PROGRESS/phase1_completion refreshed; hash recomputed.
- [🟢] Phase 1 retrospective diary + DECISIONS/LESSONS updates completed; metrics snapshot archived.

## Cumulative Metrics

- **Total Tasks Defined:** 65 (rebaselined)
- **Tasks Completed:** 65 (100%)
- **Tasks In Progress:** 0
- **Tasks Blocked:** 0
- **Average Velocity:** Stabilized (CI + frontend unit/E2E green; golden baseline+rerank under budget; Phase 1 artifacts captured)

## Next 3 Priorities

1. **Orchestrator:** Maintain Phase 2 kickoff state, refresh hashes after each slice, and ensure build plan check-ins.
2. **Silent Architect:** Draft/accept ADRs for image ingestion + rerank provider/caching; design crossmodal path and refresh/export endpoints.
3. **IKB Designer:** Design multi-container selector and crossmodal UI; plan diagnostics rail updates for rerank/provider visibility.
